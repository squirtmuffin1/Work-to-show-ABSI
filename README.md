Here are a couple java files that I have worked on.

The MecanumMovement.java file has some of my work from robotics. Specifically, lines 2600 - 2780 have most of my main navigation methods.
Most of the other methods in this file have been created by other authors and after I graduated; several of these other methods build upon 
the methods I had made. I did make a comment above each of these methods to help explain what they do. There are other methods that I have 
made in this file, but these are the most important and useful ones.

The TwoFourTree.java file is the term project for my Data Structures with Java class. I worked on it with one of my fellow students.
It defines a class for a 2/4 tree data structure.
